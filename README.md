<div align="justify">
In densely populated countries like India, I am deeply concerned about the issue of food wastage. Evidence abounds in the form of overflowing streets, brimming garbage bins, and sprawling landfills, and it signifies not only hunger and pollution but also economic challenges. The modern lifestyle, which I am a part of, characterized by rapid changes in habits and preferences, contributes to the squandering of food, clothing, and other resources.

Rather than discarding these valuable items, I believe I can channel them toward a noble cause by donating to various organizations, including orphanages and old age homes. My internet-based Android application focuses on charitable endeavors through donations. Not only does it tackle food wastage, but it also addresses other needs such as clothing, books, and utensils for those in need.

Consider the daily surplus of food in restaurants and cafes—a common occurrence. Instead of consigning it to the trash, I can ensure this excess nourishes the homeless. With pickup arrangements facilitated by my enterprise, restaurants and cafes can participate without hassle. The beneficiaries include both these establishments (reducing their carbon footprint and waste) and the underprivileged.

My project’s ultimate goal is to emphasize that investing in food wastage reduction is a logical step toward sustainable production and consumption. This encompasses food security, climate change mitigation, and other environmental concerns. I plan to develop public awareness materials and a strategic approach to achieve this mission.
